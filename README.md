I'm a passionate software developer with a diverse background. While I haven't completed my degree yet, I have pursued two faculties: mechanical engineering and software engineering. I love developing new solutions in creative ways and have experience with Python, MatLAB and databases. I also have knowledge in JavaScript, as well as a background in design, UI/UX, and marketing.

Let's embark on coding adventures together! ✨
